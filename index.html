        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Tyler Jones and I am currently a freshman at UC Riverisde. I am a very dedicated young man, I care about my academics very much. I want to become a very successful person in life and I think I have the qualites to do so. In life we have to overcome many different struggles. As me being a basketball player it has faces me with many different challnenges. I have gone through multiple different surgries on my knee and have come back stronger after each one.I think this helps me later down the line because nothing is going to be easy. If everything was easy in life everyone would be doing the same thing. We have to try to challenge ourselves in life so that we can become the best versions of ourselves. I am slowly becoming a better version of myself every single day. I think what separates me as well is the fact that I am a day to day guy. Each day is so important and I don't look so far ahead in the future.
<br><br>

        As me being an athlete I feel like it helps me in the field. This is because of the aspect of communication and working through many projects. I think me playing basketball can help with me not quitting on any job that I get in life. I think working as a team would help in the job force as well. I think being able to work with a different group of individuals is key to being succesful.<br><br>

        I think what seperates me from many people is the fact that I am very hardworking. I have been in many different jobs growing up from bagging at stores to a cashier and a waiter. I would say that my most accomplished though was when I became an Intern at a law firm. This really opened up my eyes to the real world and how work is. I got to listen in on hearings as well as do many different task around the office. This was a once and a lifetime oppurtunity that I took full advantage of. I met so many people throughout the time in the office and this helped with building many relationships. I got to talk to people about how they used their money towards different investments. I got to learn about how people became lawyers and their background history behind them.
